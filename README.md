# UFOs

## Overview of the analysis:
The purpose of this webpage is to display the data set of UFO sightings in the form of a table with filtering abilities. The table is dynamic and can be filtered by date, city, state, country, and shape.

## Results:
To the left of the table is a filter search box. There you can enter a date, city, state, country, or shape and the table will update when a character is present and enter is pressed

## Summary:
A drawback to the webpage is the filter can only look at one id at a time. For example you cannot look at the state of California and Kentucky at the same time.

A drop down menu where you can pick multiple criteria would eliminate this drawback. Also the ability to sort the table by more recent or least recent would improve user experience.
